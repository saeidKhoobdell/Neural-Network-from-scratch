Heart Disease Prediction Neural Network

This repository contains a simple neural network implementation for heart disease prediction using Python and NumPy.

Implementation :

Load and preprocess the dataset.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Scale the data using StandardScaler.

Define a neural network class (NN) with a sigmoid activation function.

Train the neural network using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

Evaluate the model on the test set and display accuracy and a confusion matrix.
